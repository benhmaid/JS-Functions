# JS-Functions

#### We create functionality for adding students to a class.

* There can be only 6 students in a class. If more students are tried to be added, log out the following: "Cannot add more students to class 07".
* The same person cannot be added to the class.
* If the Queen is added to the class she should always get a space.
* You cannot add an empty string to a class
